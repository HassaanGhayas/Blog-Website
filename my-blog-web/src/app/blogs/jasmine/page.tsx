            Jasmine, a delicate and fragrant flower, is known for its ethereal
            beauty and intoxicating scent, especially when it blooms in the
            evening. Revered in many cultures for its elegance and soothing
            fragrance, jasmine has earned the title of “night bloomer” due to
            its unique characteristic of releasing its fragrance after sunset.
            Its small, star-shaped blossoms may appear modest, but they hold the
            power to captivate the senses and stir emotions, making jasmine a
            cherished flower worldwide.

            In the language of flowers, daisies have long been associated with
            purity, innocence, and fresh beginnings. This connection to
            innocence is rooted in ancient lore, where daisies were often seen
            as a representation of youthful spirit and untainted love. For this
            reason, they are often included in bridal bouquets, symbolizing a
            pure heart and new beginnings.

            Jasmine has long been a symbol of love, purity, and sensuality. In
            various cultures, it is associated with romance and spirituality,
            its sweet fragrance often linked to the mysteries of the night. The
            name "jasmine" itself is derived from the Persian word Yasmin,
            meaning "gift from God," which reflects the deep reverence many
            cultures hold for this beautiful bloom.

            In the language of flowers, jasmine represents affection and
            elegance. Its delicate white blossoms symbolize purity and
            simplicity, while its strong, alluring scent suggests hidden depths
            of passion and mystery. Jasmine flowers are often woven into
            garlands or used in bridal bouquets in South Asian and Middle
            Eastern cultures, where they are a symbol of beauty and love.

            One of the most fascinating aspects of jasmine is its nocturnal
            blooming. While some species of jasmine, such as Common Jasmine
            (Jasminum officinale), bloom during the day, others like
            Night-Blooming Jasmine (Cestrum nocturnum) release their scent
            predominantly at night. This characteristic is what makes jasmine so
            enchanting—its fragrance becomes stronger as the sun sets, filling
            the air with a sweet, intoxicating aroma.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The reason jasmine blooms at night is rooted in its pollination
            strategy. Night-blooming jasmine relies on nocturnal pollinators,
            such as moths, which are drawn to its strong fragrance. This
            evolutionary trait has made jasmine a favorite among night gardeners
            and those who appreciate the beauty of a moonlit garden.

            Jasmine holds deep cultural significance in many parts of the world.
            In India, jasmine is known as "Mogra" and is considered sacred,
            often used in religious ceremonies and offerings to deities. It is
            also a symbol of divine hope and spiritual awakening. Jasmine
            garlands are commonly used in weddings and festive occasions,
            symbolizing love, purity, and prosperity.

            In the Middle East, jasmine is associated with love and sensuality.
            It is often found in perfumes and oils, its rich, sweet scent used
            to evoke feelings of romance and allure. Jasmine tea, popular in
            China, is a delicately flavored drink infused with the fragrance of
            jasmine blossoms, known for its calming properties and association
            with relaxation and tranquility.

            In the Philippines, jasmine, or "Sampaguita", is the national
            flower. It represents purity, simplicity, and humility. The flower
            is often used in traditional events and ceremonies, and its white
            blossoms are symbolic of the country’s natural beauty and cultural
            heritage.
