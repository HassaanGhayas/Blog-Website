            In the language of flowers, daisies have long been associated with
            purity, innocence, and fresh beginnings. This connection to
            innocence is rooted in ancient lore, where daisies were often seen
            as a representation of youthful spirit and untainted love. For this
            reason, they are often included in bridal bouquets, symbolizing a
            pure heart and new beginnings.

            Daisies also represent loyalty and patience. Their straightforward,
            unassuming beauty reflects the idea that happiness can be found in
            simple pleasures, and their sturdy nature symbolizes endurance and
            perseverance in the face of challenges.

            Daisies are often associated with happiness and positivity, making
            them a popular gift for occasions like birthdays, celebrations, or
            to simply brighten someone&apos;s day. Their cheerful appearance
            instantly lifts the spirits, spreading joy wherever they bloom.

            Daisies are often seen growing in meadows, fields, and along
            roadsides, evoking a sense of freedom and natural beauty. Their
            wild, untamed nature symbolizes a carefree spirit and a connection
            to the earth. Daisies remind us that beauty can be found in the
            simplest, most unassuming things, and that nature&apos;s gifts are often
            the most cherished.

            Because of their association with simplicity, daisies are frequently
            featured in bohemian-style weddings and outdoor events, where their
            natural charm and rustic elegance fit perfectly. They are a reminder
            that true beauty does not need to be extravagant—it can be found in
            the small, everyday moments of joy.

            Daisies have a rich history in folklore and mythology. In Roman
            mythology, the daisy was associated with the goddess Belides, who
            transformed herself into the flower to escape the unwanted attention
            of the god of orchards, Vertumnus. This story gave rise to the
            belief that daisies represent innocence and modesty.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In Norse mythology, the daisy is linked to Freya, the goddess of
            love, beauty, and fertility. As such, daisies became a symbol of
            motherhood, childbirth, and new beginnings. This connection to
            motherhood and fertility made daisies a traditional flower to give
            to new mothers, symbolizing joy and the innocence of a newborn
            child.

            Daisies are a favorite among gardeners, not only for their beauty
            but also for their resilience and ease of care. These hardy
            perennials can thrive in a variety of environments, from sunny
            meadows to garden beds. They prefer well-drained soil and full
            sunlight, but can adapt to a range of conditions, making them a
            versatile addition to any landscape.
