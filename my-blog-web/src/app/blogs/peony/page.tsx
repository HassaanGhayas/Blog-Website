            Peonies have long been associated with wealth, honor, and romance,
            especially in Asian cultures. In Chinese tradition, the peony is
            often referred to as the "king of flowers" and is a symbol of
            prosperity, good fortune, and honor. It is prominently featured in
            Chinese art, literature, and even celebrations, especially during
            weddings, where it represents a wish for a happy, prosperous
            marriage.

            Peonies have been cultivated for thousands of years, with their
            origins traced back to China and parts of Europe. The flower's name
            comes from "Paeon," the Greek physician to the gods, who used the
            peony’s healing properties to treat wounds and ailments. As such,
            peonies were once valued for their medicinal properties, believed to
            help with everything from digestive issues to soothing nerves.

            Throughout history, peonies have held special cultural significance.
            In China, they are revered as a national flower and have been
            celebrated in festivals and art for centuries. In Europe, they
            became a favorite of royal and aristocratic gardens, thanks to their
            dramatic beauty and fragrant blooms.

            These varieties come in a rainbow of colors, ranging from soft
            pastels to deep, rich hues. The sheer variety of peonies means that
            they can suit any aesthetic, from delicate, romantic settings to
            bold, luxurious landscapes.

            Peonies are relatively easy to grow and can live for decades, making
            them a beloved staple in many gardens. They prefer well-drained soil
            and full sunlight, and while they take a few years to fully
            establish, the reward is a breathtaking display of blooms year after
            year.

            One of the most remarkable features of peonies is their longevity.
            Once planted, peonies can continue to bloom for up to 100 years with
            minimal care, making them a symbol of lasting beauty and resilience.
            Their hardiness also makes them a popular choice in both home
            gardens and large estates.

            Peonies have inspired artists, poets, and designers for centuries.
            In Chinese art, the peony is frequently featured in paintings,
            textiles, and ceramics, often symbolizing wealth, honor, and
            feminine beauty. European artists, particularly during the Victorian
            era, also embraced the peony for its lush, opulent form, using it as
            a symbol of romance and refinement.

            With their full, romantic blooms, peonies are a favorite flower for

            decorations, peonies add a sense of romance and luxury to any
            celebration. Their soft, pastel colors make them ideal for spring
            and summer weddings, while their larger size allows them to stand
